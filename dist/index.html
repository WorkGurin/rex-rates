                <p>This is a somewhat contrived example of a histogram showing salaries of React developers by state and by year. Users can click a combination of buttons, and the histogram will update with filtered data and a new description and title.</p>

                <h3>React + D3.js</h3>
                <p>This site was built with React and D3.js. React takes care of user input and D3.js takes care of the visualization. The DOM is being controlled by React, not D3.js. Built with Webpack for bundling and babel for some ES6 features. See how it was built <a href="https://github.com/janaipakos/react-d3-data-viz">here</a>.</p>
